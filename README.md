# Computer Vision on CIFAR-10 Color Images Classification Dataset


To run this code, assuming it is all in the directory as uploaded simply run
analysis.py or test_classification.py. For the latter I suggest using the
Test Classification jupyter notebook instead to test it as it is far cleaner
and more readable. analysis.py will take an incredibly long time to run, so keep
that in mind. On average to run the entirety of that file it would take me around
5 hours, I suggest running it in pieces.
